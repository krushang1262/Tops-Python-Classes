1) What are the types of Applications? 
=> Applications are classified into Desktop, Web, Mobile applications.

=> Desktop Applications
 Run on a computer (Windows / Linux / Mac) ex: calc, notpad, msword

=> Web Applications
Run on the internet using a browser ex: Gmail, Facebook, Online Shopping websites

=> Mobile Applications
Run on smartphones (Android / iOS) ex: WhatsApp, Instagram, Paytm

2) What is programing? 
=> Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer so that it can perform a specific task.

3) What is Python? 
=> Python is a high-level, interpreted, and easy-to-learn programming language used to develop different types of applications.

7) How memory is managed in Python? 
=> Python managed the memory automatically, so the programmer does not need to allocate or free memory manually.

8) What is the purpose continuing statement in python?
=> The continue statement is used inside loops to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.

17) What are negative indexes and why are they used?
=> Negative indexes are used to access elements from the end of a sequence (like string, list, tuple). 
=> Negative indexes are used because they make it easy to work with elements from the end of a sequence.

25) What is List? How will you reverse a list?
=> A list is a mutable, ordered collection of elements in Python.
A list can be reversed using the reverse() method, slicing, or a loop

26) How will you remove last object from a list?
=> The last object of a list can be removed using the pop() method

27) Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?
=> 25 is the value of -1 

28) Differentiate between append() and extend() methods?
=> append() method add the single item. and extend() method add the multiple items in the list.

30) How will you compare two lists? 
=> Two lists can be compared using == operator.

43) What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple
=> A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python.
The main difference between list and tuple is that a list is mutable while a tuple is immutable. 

47) How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?
=> You can create a dictionary from tuples when each tuple contains a key–value pair.

51) How Do You Traverse Through a Dictionary Object in Python?
=> A Dictionary python store the key value pair not the index based position like list.
=> Traversal is done through the key value or both together  instead of indexed number.

52) How Do You Check the Presence of a Key in A Dictionary? 
=> The presence of a key in a dictionary is checked using the 
membership operator, which verifies whether the specified key exists among the dictionary’s keys.
